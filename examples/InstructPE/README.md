This project is implemented for the paper: "[DiffChat: Learning to Chat with Text-to-Image Synthesis Models for Interactive Image Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04997)".

## Data
We released our collected InstructPE dataset ([train](https://atp-modelzoo-sh.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/release/tutorials/InstructPE/InstructPE_train.json), [test](https://atp-modelzoo-sh.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/release/tutorials/InstructPE/InstructPE_test.json)), which is organized as <"source_prompt", "instruction", "beautified_source_prompt", "beautified_target_prompt"> for each sample.
